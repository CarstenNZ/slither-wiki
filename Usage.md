## How to run Slither

### Truffle
To run Slither on a Truffle directory:
```
slither .
```

Use `--ignore-truffle-compile` to not run `truffle compile` with Slither.

Use `--truffle-version truffle@x.x.x` to use a specific version of Truffle. For example:
```
slither . --truffle-version truffle@4.1.14
```
Will run Slither with the latest 0.4 Truffle (through npx).

Use `--truffle-build-directory` to specify a [custom build directory](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration#contracts_build_directory).

### solc
To run Slither from a Solidity file:

```
slither file.sol
```
By default `solc` is used. To use another version, use:
```
slither file.sol --solc /path/to/solc
```

### AST file
To run Slither on a AST file generated by solc, run:
```
slither file.ast.json
```

## Options

- To disable the solc warnings: `--disable-solc-warnings`
- To disable the output colorization: `--disable-color`
- To export the result to a json file: `--json file.json`

### Detectors selection
By default, slither run all the detectors.

To run only selected detectors, use `--detect detector1,detector2`. For example:
```
slither file.sol --detect arbitrary-send,pragma
```

To exclude detectors, use `--exclude detector1,detector2`. For example:
```
slither file.sol --exclude naming-convention,unused-state,suicidal
```

To exclude detectors with an informational or low severity, use `--exclude-informational` or `--exclude-low`.

`--list-detectors` lists [available detectors](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Detectors-Documentation).

### Printers selection
By default, no printer are run.

To run selected printers, use `--print printer1,printer2`. For example:
```
slither file.sol --print inheritance-graph
```

`--list-printers` lists [available printers](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printers-Documentation).

### Path filtering

`--filter-paths path1,path2` will exclude all the results that are only related to `path1` and `path2`. The path specified can be a path directory or a filename. It is used as a direct text comparison, and there is no regular expression supported.

Examples:
```
slither . --filter-paths openzepellin
```
Filter all the results only related to openzepellin.
```
slither . --filter-paths SafeMath.sol
```
Filter all the results only related to the file `SafeMath.sol`.

### Triage mode

`--triage-mode` run slither in its triage mode. For every finding, Slither will ask if the result should be shown for the next run.
Results are saved in `slither.db.json`.

Examples:
```
slither . --triage-mode
[...]
0: C.destination (test.sol#3) is never initialized. It is used in:
	- f (test.sol#5-7)
Reference: https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Vulnerabilities-Description#uninitialized-state-variables
Results to hide during next runs: "0,1,..." or "All" (enter to not hide results):  0
[...]
```

The second run of Slither will hide the above result.

To show the hidden results again, delete `slither.db.json`.

### Configuration File
Some options can be set through a json configuration file. By default,  `slither.conf.json` is used if present (it can be changed through `--config-file file.conf.json`).

If an option is set by the configuration file and the command line, the command line option is selected;

The following flags are supported:

```
{
    "detectors_to_run": "detector1,detector2",
    "printers_to_run": "printer1,printer2",
    "detectors_to_exclude": "detector1,detector2",
    "exclude_informational": false,
    "exclude_low": false,
    "exclude_medium": false,
    "exclude_high": false,
    "solc": "solc",
    "solc_args": "",
    "disable_solc_warnings": false,
    "json": "",
    "truffle_build_directory": "custom/path",
    "truffle_version": "truffle@x.x.x",
    "disable_color": false,
    "filter_paths": "file1.sol,file2.sol",
    "ignore_truffle_compile": false,
    "legacy_ast": false
}
```
